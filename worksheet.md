Take a look at the two repositories:

- (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
- (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

- These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites? What service do they provide? Which is better?

Mathew Roberts

- Who made the first commit to repository A?

- ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it. It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method. Try them out. You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

```
Red vs. Blue
```
